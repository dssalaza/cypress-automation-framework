# cypress-automation-framework
A repo for applying all the automation concepts and suggested practices learned so far using Cypress and TypeScript.

# Notes
1 In cypress.json "chromeWebSecurity": false is set in that way because the web application is accessing a cross-origin frame, hence it blocks the browser.
2 Create cypress.env.json file at a root level of the project and add the password provided in the webpage.
